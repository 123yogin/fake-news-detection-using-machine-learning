## Introduction
This repository contains a machine learning project for detecting fake news. The goal is to develop a system capable of classifying news articles as real or fake using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms.

## Features
- Preprocessing of textual data using NLP techniques.
- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms for classification.
- Evaluation of model accuracy and performance metrics.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/123yogin/fake-news-detection-using-machine-learning.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd fake-news-detection-using-machine-learning
   ```
3. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset or use the provided dataset.
2. Train and evaluate the machine learning model by running the `Fake_News_Detector-PA.ipynb` file:
   - Open a terminal and launch Jupyter Notebook:
     ```
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Open the `Fake_News_Detector-PA.ipynb` file and execute all cells in sequence.
3. To run the application, use the following command:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes news articles labeled as real or fake. Please ensure you have the dataset prepared in the appropriate format before running the scripts.

## Model Details
The project explores the use of the **Passive Aggressive Classifier** for detecting fake news. Additionally, it includes the process of **lemmatization**, which involves reducing words to their base or root form to improve text preprocessing and model efficiency.

## Results
The project evaluates the performance of the models using metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

You can find the detailed analysis and visualizations included in the Jupyter Notebook.
